# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The StudyNotes team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@studynotes.com**

Include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Fix Development**: We will work on developing a fix for the vulnerability
4. **Testing**: We will thoroughly test the fix to ensure it resolves the issue
5. **Release**: We will release the fix and publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you if desired)

### Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The main StudyNotes application
- API endpoints
- Database security
- Authentication and authorization systems
- File upload functionality
- Third-party integrations

### Out of Scope

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:
- Issues in third-party libraries (please report to the respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to the server

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Frontend Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Use React's built-in XSS protection and avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Secure Headers**: Set appropriate security headers

```jsx
// ✅ Good: Proper input handling
const sanitizeInput = (input) => {
  return input.replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '');
};

// ❌ Bad: Direct HTML insertion
const Component = ({ userContent }) => (
  <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userContent }} />
);
```

#### Backend Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use prepared statements
- **Authentication**: Implement secure JWT handling
- **Authorization**: Verify user permissions for each action
- **File Upload Security**: Validate file types and sizes

```php
// ✅ Good: Prepared statement
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM notes WHERE user_id = ? AND id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$userId, $noteId]);

// ❌ Bad: Direct query concatenation
$query = "SELECT * FROM notes WHERE user_id = " . $userId . " AND id = " . $noteId;
```

#### Database Security
- **Access Control**: Use principle of least privilege
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- **Backup Security**: Secure database backups
- **Connection Security**: Use SSL/TLS for database connections

### Environment Security

#### Development Environment
```env
# Use strong, unique secrets
JWT_SECRET=your-super-strong-secret-key-here
DB_PASSWORD=complex-password-123!

# Never commit real credentials
# Use .env.example for templates
```

#### Production Environment
```env
# Production security settings
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
DB_SSL_MODE=require
SESSION_SECURE=true
SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true
```

### Secure Coding Checklist

#### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated on both client and server
- [ ] File uploads are restricted by type, size, and content
- [ ] SQL queries use prepared statements
- [ ] XSS protection is implemented for user-generated content

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt or similar
- [ ] JWT tokens have appropriate expiration times
- [ ] Session management is secure
- [ ] User permissions are checked for each operation

#### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- [ ] Personal information follows privacy regulations
- [ ] Database backups are encrypted
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive information

#### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Dependencies are regularly updated
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

We aim to resolve security vulnerabilities according to the following timeline:

- **Critical**: 24-48 hours
- **High**: 7 days
- **Medium**: 30 days
- **Low**: 90 days

## Security Updates

Security updates will be published:
1. As patch releases to the affected versions
2. In the security advisories section
3. Through our notification channels

## Security Hall of Fame

We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize researchers who have helped improve our security:

<!-- Security researchers will be listed here -->
