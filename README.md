Student Note-Taking Website
Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple and effective web application that helps students stay organized, take notes for their different modules, and improve their learning and revision process.

Key Features
Each student will be able to:

Add notes for different modules (e.g., Web, OOP, Math, etc.)

Edit their notes at any time

Delete notes they no longer need

Organize notes by module

Note: Organization by chapters or specific topics may be added in the future.

Technologies to Use
PHP — Handles server-side logic (create, edit, delete notes)

MySQL — Stores data (notes, modules, users)

CSS — Designs the website layout, colors, and structure

JavaScript — Adds interactivity (modals, alerts, dynamic buttons)

Future Enhancements (AI Integration)
Integrate Artificial Intelligence to:

Generate summaries from students’ notes

Create quizzes to help students review their content
